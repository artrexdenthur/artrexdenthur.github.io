I"#<p>Over the holidays as I desired to a) visit various and sundry family members and b) also get some coding done in my limited spare holiday time, it became clear that the intersection of these two projects required that I bring a different computer than the one I had been used to coding with. The clearly correct candidate was an old MacBook Pro that had been gathering dust after being replaced a few years ago. I had not had much experience with a Mac before, but it couldnâ€™t be that hard to switch over for some minor coding, could it?</p>
