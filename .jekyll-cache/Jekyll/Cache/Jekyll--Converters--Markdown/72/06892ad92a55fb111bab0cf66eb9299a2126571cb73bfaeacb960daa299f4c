I"È<p>One of the great puzzles in designing a readable programming language is setting the right balance between readability in compactness. On one extreme, â€˜readabilityâ€™ can go so far that code is too verbose to actually read (and especially write) quickly. On the other, intentionally making code compact eventually results in longer periods for both reading and writing as well, since compressed symbols become arbitrary and difficult to remember.</p>
