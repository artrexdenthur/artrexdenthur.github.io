The very basics of really being on the internet

## Intro

As you may guess, this is the point where this blog started being primarily [www.paulashour.com](www.paulashour.com) and not just [artrexdenthur.github.io](artrexdenthur.github.io). Unsurprisingly the course at Flatiron didn't cover the nitty gritty of *having a website*, since that's the sort of thing the person you're building a website for generally handles. And heck, if it's a very small business they'll get Wordpress etc. to do it for them. So there was some learning involved in getting my very own self-titled website, and while it's not difficult material, it is interesting and revealing about some of the inner workings of the internet. If you want the more clinical version, [this](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain) is the correct help page to get a custom domain configured for a Github Pages site. My post here will display a bit more curiosity and verbosity.

## DNS

If you're here, you've probably seen the illustrations of computers connected to each other. Here's a simple one from Wikipedia:

The caption comments that the upper Network Topology diagram is all applications usually have to worry about. The routers on either end of the communication do all the heavy lifting of getting information from point A to point B.
But to understand how to configue the domain name you've just bought, you'll have to peel away the wrapper from a piece of that abstraction: The Domain Name System, or DNS.
