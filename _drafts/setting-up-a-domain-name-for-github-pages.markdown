The very basics of really being on the internet

## Intro

As you may guess, this is the point where this blog started being primarily [www.paulashour.com](www.paulashour.com) and not just [artrexdenthur.github.io](artrexdenthur.github.io). Unsurprisingly the course at Flatiron didn't cover the nitty gritty of *having a website*, since that's the sort of thing the person you're building a website for generally handles. And heck, if it's a very small business they'll get Wordpress etc. to do it for them. So there was some learning involved in getting my very own self-titled website, and while it's not difficult material, it is interesting and revealing about some of the inner workings of the internet. If you want the clinical TLDR, [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) is their relevant help page (which is sort of buried amongst similar pages that aren't as helpful)

## So how does the internet work?

If you're here, you've probably seen the illustrations of computers connected to each other. Here's a good one:


## DNS

The Domain Name System, or DNS, is the set of standards and protocols for allowing people and programs to find things on the internet. Most relatably to people, it's the system that allows you to type in www.google.com and just wait for the various routers acting as middlemen to figure out that you want the server labeled 172.217.9.36, find the best path between you and that server, and start relaying packets back and forth.
